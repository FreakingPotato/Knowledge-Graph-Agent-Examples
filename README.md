## How it works

Every project under this repo was built by the same pipeline of single-purpose agents:

```
Architect          → ontology.json
                    ↓
Discoverer         → papers.json + candidates.json   (OpenAlex / arXiv / bioRxiv)
                    ↓
Scorers ×3         → scored_<paradigm>.json          (parallel, one per paradigm)
                    ↓
Reviewer           → evidence.json                   (primary / secondary tiers)
                    ↓
   ┌───────────┬───────────┬───────────┐
   ▼           ▼           ▼           ▼
PDF fetcher  Ranker      Linker (H)   Planning Linker
                          ↓           ↓
                       paragraph PNGs (multi-sentence highlighted)
                          ↓
                       QC checker  → qc_report.{json,md}
                          ↓
                       Auditor    → standalone graph.html
```

Agents communicate through versioned data files only. Each agent's logic is also a CLI script under each project's `scripts/` directory, so any pipeline stage can be re-run deterministically.

## Adding a new project

1. Create a new sub-directory next to `multimodal_genomics/`.
2. Author a topic-specific `metadata/ontology.json` (paradigms, claims, 5-dimension rubric, high-impact venue allowlist).
3. Re-run the standard pipeline scripts (most are topic-agnostic — copy them from an existing project and re-path to the new metadata directory).
4. Build the project landing page (`index.html` modeled on `multimodal_genomics/index.html`).
5. Add a project card to the top-level `index.html` hub.
